This is the personal blog of Chris Wilkinson. 

I am a Software Engineer who has worked in various roles in the Software industry for over 16 years. I like to work on projects outside of my day job, and this blog serves as a view into that work. Broadly speaking, the content here divides into Quantative Finance, Home Automation, and General Tips/Hacks.
